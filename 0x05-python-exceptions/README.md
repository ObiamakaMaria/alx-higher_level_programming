This is my Python - Exceptions project.

This project contains task in which the following concepts were implemented :

. What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
. What are exceptions and how to use them
. When do we need to use exceptions
. How to correctly handle an exception
. What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
. How to raise a builtin exception
. When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception
